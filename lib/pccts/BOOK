GETTING A COPY OF THE BOOK

A Book on PCCTS (ANTLR, DLG, and SORCERER) is nearing completion.
If you are interested in getting a prerelease version, simply
grab

	ftp://ftp.parr-research.com/pub/pccts/Book/reference.ps

(there is also a gzip'd version).  I'm sorry that PostScript is the
only way to distribute the book at the moment.  If you promise to do
an incredible job of reviewing I might find it in my heart to USNail
you a hardcopy :)


REVIEWS/SUGGESTIONS

[We are not interested in small problems with grammar etc... at the moment.
 We are looking for structure problems, code bugs, totally screwed up sentences
 and similar things.  We'll get down to the small stuff right before going
 to press.]

If you would like to send information/suggestions/bug reports etc...
about the book that you've read, please send email to

	pcctsbk@parr-research.com

with a 'Subject:' line of

	review VERSION

where VERSION is either "initial" or whatever the header/footer says
(should be a version number on the next version posted).  You can also
send hardcopy reviews back to:

Los Altos, CA. 94022-1433
phone: 415-428-4200

All other 'Subject:' lines are ignored.  Please send anything other

Regards,
